          It's Q1, and on most campuses, spring operations are hitting full speed. Financial aid
          teams are pushing out final disbursements. Enrollment leaders are monitoring melt risk. IT
          is fielding new tickets. Advisors are checking early alerts. And across all of it—often
          under the surface—an aging ERP or SIS may be slowing everything down.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-10 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          These systems tend to stay invisible to senior leadership until something breaks or an
          audit looms. But the real cost of outdated ERP and SIS platforms isn't just about uptime
          or maintenance. It shows up as missed enrollment opportunities, manual workarounds that
          burn staff time, and student friction that damages retention.

          When "It Still Works" Is Actually a Liability
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          For years, many institutions have operated under a simple assumption: if the ERP or SIS is
          still technically functional, there's no urgency to upgrade. But function alone doesn't
          mean fitness for today's demands. Across campuses relying on aging platforms, the hidden
          costs fall into four key areas.

          While student experience often gets the most attention, compliance risk quietly grows in
          outdated ERP and SIS environments. Institutions relying on legacy systems frequently
          encounter incomplete or delayed reporting for Title IV and accreditation, manual SAP
          checks that increase error risk, unclear audit trails or inconsistent policy enforcement,
          and cybersecurity vulnerabilities from unpatched or unsupported systems. As federal and
          state scrutiny increases, legacy platforms can become serious liabilities during a
          surprise audit or program review.

          Why Modernization Gets Stuck—and How to Unstick It
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          If the risks and costs are so clear, why do so many institutions delay modernization?
          Common barriers include fear of disrupting core operations during peak cycles, sticker
          shock tied to perceived total cost of replacement platforms, lack of alignment between IT,
          finance, and enrollment leadership, and limited internal capacity to lead large-scale
          change.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-10 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          The result is a prolonged "just make it work" mindset—year after year of investing in
          systems that no longer support institutional goals. But this doesn't have to be permanent.

            "When was the last time the president, CIO, and CFO sat down together to talk about

        <p className="mb-10 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          For too many institutions, the answer is: <em>"It's been a while."</em> That gap—between
          strategic leadership and technology execution—is quietly undermining enrollment, student
          experience, and financial sustainability. And fixing it doesn't require a new system. It
          requires a new cadence of leadership alignment.

          The Cost of Misalignment Isn't Just Operational—It's Strategic

          On most campuses, presidents, CIOs, and CFOs all care deeply about institutional success.

          Institutions making the most progress with technology transformation tend to do one simple
          thing well: they hold regular, structured conversations between the president, CIO, and
          CFO focused on technology as institutional strategy. Not a line-item budget review. Not a
          quarterly IT status update. A true leadership dialogue centered on shared impact.

          At its core, technology defines your institution's capacity to deliver on its mission.
          Financial aid automation gives time back to counselors and speeds packaging. CRM–SIS

            If it's been a while since your president, CIO, and CFO sat together to discuss
