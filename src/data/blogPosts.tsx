          It's Q1, and on most campuses, spring operations are hitting full speed. Financial aid
          teams are pushing out final disbursements. Enrollment leaders are monitoring melt risk. IT
          is fielding new tickets. Advisors are checking early alerts. And across all of it—often
          under the surface—an aging ERP or SIS may be slowing everything down.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-10 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          These systems tend to stay invisible to senior leadership until something breaks or an
          audit looms. But the real cost of outdated ERP and SIS platforms isn't just about uptime
          or maintenance. It shows up as missed enrollment opportunities, manual workarounds that
          burn staff time, and student friction that damages retention.

          When "It Still Works" Is Actually a Liability
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          For years, many institutions have operated under a simple assumption: if the ERP or SIS is
          still technically functional, there's no urgency to upgrade. But function alone doesn't
          mean fitness for today's demands. Across campuses relying on aging platforms, the hidden
          costs fall into four key areas.

          While student experience often gets the most attention, compliance risk quietly grows in
          outdated ERP and SIS environments. Institutions relying on legacy systems frequently
          encounter incomplete or delayed reporting for Title IV and accreditation, manual SAP
          checks that increase error risk, unclear audit trails or inconsistent policy enforcement,
          and cybersecurity vulnerabilities from unpatched or unsupported systems. As federal and
          state scrutiny increases, legacy platforms can become serious liabilities during a
          surprise audit or program review.

          Why Modernization Gets Stuck—and How to Unstick It
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          If the risks and costs are so clear, why do so many institutions delay modernization?
          Common barriers include fear of disrupting core operations during peak cycles, sticker
          shock tied to perceived total cost of replacement platforms, lack of alignment between IT,
          finance, and enrollment leadership, and limited internal capacity to lead large-scale
          change.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-10 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          The result is a prolonged "just make it work" mindset—year after year of investing in
          systems that no longer support institutional goals. But this doesn't have to be permanent.

          Outdated or disconnected platforms send implicit messages about institutional readiness. A
          confusing login portal signals disorganization. A poor financial aid dashboard suggests
          students must navigate challenges on their own. These friction points particularly impact
          vulnerable populations—first-generation students, low-income students, and adult learners
          who have less margin for error and less tolerance for institutional confusion.

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          When a student cannot easily access their aid status, understand their billing, or connect

          the institution as indifferent—regardless of how much the institution cares in practice.

          Banner is not a project. It is a core enterprise platform designed specifically for higher
          education—and institutions that treat it as such succeed.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          Implementations fail when treated as short-term initiatives. They succeed when institutions
          view Banner as a long-lived institutional asset requiring governance, ownership, and
          executive accountability. For CIOs, Banner represents a system of record for academic and
          student data, a security and compliance boundary, a reporting and analytics backbone, and a
          long-term staffing commitment.

          Weak executive sponsorship creates downstream problems including endless configuration
          reversals, shadow systems, and technical debt masked as exceptions. Banner requires
          definitive decisions; unresolved policy questions eventually manifest as workarounds.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          Institutions should evaluate both technical and operational readiness simultaneously:

          Part II: Architecture and Environment Strategy
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          High-performing institutions maintain distinct environments: Development, Test/UAT,
          Training, Reporting (isolated analytics workloads), and Production (strictly operational).
          Banner performance issues typically stem from architectural problems rather than
          Banner-specific constraints—inefficient indexing, heavy reporting queries on transactional
          tables, and underestimated peak loads.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
          Part III: Data Migration as Institutional Governance
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          Successful migrations avoid transferring unnecessary historical data. Active students
          receive full-fidelity migration; inactive students and alumni require transcript-level data
          only; legacy artifacts are archived externally. Banner demands clarity regarding ownership
          of academic terms, program codes, and organizational hierarchies—without formal governance,
          reporting becomes fragmented and integrations grow fragile.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
          Part IV: Configuration Decisions With Technical Consequences
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          Registrar decisions directly influence financial aid eligibility, billing logic, enrollment
          reporting, and graduation audits. Banner rewards institutional simplification. Financial Aid
          configuration requires segregation of duties, documented packaging logic, annual FAFSA
          validation cycles, and role-based access audits.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
          Part V: Integrations and Ecosystem Design
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          Each integration must define system of record, data ownership, sync frequency, and error
          handling. Treating integrations as isolated connections creates brittle systems requiring
          manual reconciliation. Banner reporting struggles usually stem from upstream configuration
          issues—inconsistent codes, undefined business rules, and overloaded transactional
          environments.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          Untrained users introduce risk through bad data, workarounds, and reporting distrust.
          Effective training is role-based, scenario-driven, and reinforced post-launch.
          Documentation protects institutions against staff turnover, audit exposure, and
          reimplementation costs. Successful launches occur away from peak academic periods and
          include freeze protocols and clear escalation paths.

            enrollment strategies.
